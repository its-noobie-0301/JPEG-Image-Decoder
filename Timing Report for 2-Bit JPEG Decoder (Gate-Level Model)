This report summarizes the key timing parameters for the 2-bit JPEG decoder, derived from the simulation waveform and gate-level design analysis. The decoder processes 2-bit input data using a state machine (IDLE → DECODE → OUTPUT → IDLE) with a clock period of 10 ns.
1. Clock Period

Clock Period: 10 ns
Derived from the testbench (forever #5 clk = ~clk), the clock toggles every 5 ns, resulting in a 10 ns period.



2. Total Circuit Delay

Logical Delay (Clock Cycles): 20 ns
The decoder takes 2 clock cycles (IDLE → DECODE → OUTPUT) to process an input.
2 cycles × 10 ns = 20 ns.


Estimated Combinational Gate-Level Delay: 195 ps
Critical path across 2 cycles:
Cycle 1 (IDLE → DECODE): 115 ps (1 NOR + 2 AND + 1 OR + DFF clock-to-Q).
Cycle 2 (DECODE → OUTPUT): 80 ps (output logic + DFF clock-to-Q).
Total: 115 ps + 80 ps = 195 ps.


Note: The synchronous design makes the effective delay 20 ns (governed by clock cycles).



3. Delay Between Input and Output

Definition: Time from when data_in is applied with valid_in = 1 to when pixel_out is valid with valid_out = 1.
Delay (Waveform): 20 ns
valid_in asserted at 30 ns, valid_out asserted at 50 ns.
50 ns - 30 ns = 20 ns (2 clock cycles).


Estimated Combinational Gate-Level Delay: 195 ps
Same as the total circuit delay, as it follows the same critical path.



4. Delay Between valid_in and valid_out

Definition: Time from when valid_in is asserted to when valid_out is asserted.
Delay (Waveform): 20 ns
valid_in goes high at 30 ns, valid_out goes high at 50 ns.
50 ns - 30 ns = 20 ns (2 clock cycles).


Estimated Combinational Gate-Level Delay: 180 ps
Cycle 1: 115 ps (state transition logic).
Cycle 2: 65 ps (valid_out logic: 1 AND + DFF clock-to-Q).
Total: 115 ps + 65 ps = 180 ps.
Effective delay remains 20 ns due to synchronous design.



5. Time Taken for 2-Bit Image Decoding (Single 2-Bit Pixel)

Definition: Time to decode one 2-bit input (e.g., one pixel).
Time (Waveform): 20 ns
From valid_in = 1 at 30 ns to valid_out = 1 at 50 ns: 20 ns (2 clock cycles).


Estimated Combinational Gate-Level Delay: 180 ps
Same as the delay between valid_in and valid_out.



6. State Transition Timings (Waveform-Based)
The following timings are observed for each test case in the waveform (0 ns to 180 ns):

Test Case 1 (Input 00):

valid_in asserted: 30 ns
State to DECODE: 40 ns
State to OUTPUT, valid_out asserted: 50 ns
State back to IDLE: 60 ns
Decoding Time: 20 ns (30 ns to 50 ns)


Test Case 2 (Input 01):

valid_in asserted: 60 ns
State to DECODE: 70 ns
State to OUTPUT, valid_out asserted: 80 ns
State back to IDLE: 90 ns
Decoding Time: 20 ns (60 ns to 80 ns)


Test Case 3 (Input 10):

valid_in asserted: 90 ns
State to DECODE: 100 ns
State to OUTPUT, valid_out asserted: 110 ns
State back to IDLE: 120 ns
Decoding Time: 20 ns (90 ns to 110 ns)


Test Case 4 (Input 11):

valid_in asserted: 120 ns
State to DECODE: 130 ns
State to OUTPUT, valid_out asserted: 140 ns
State back to IDLE: 150 ns
Decoding Time: 20 ns (120 ns to 140 ns)


Test Case 5 (No valid_in):

valid_in remains 0: 150 ns to 180 ns
No state transition, no output.
Decoding Time: N/A



7. Reset Timing

Reset Assertion: 0 ns to 20 ns
Reset Deassertion: 20 ns
Outputs Cleared: By 20 ns (pixel_out = 00, valid_out = 0)

Note: All waveform-based timings are governed by the synchronous design (clock period and cycles). Gate-level estimates assume typical delays (e.g., AND: 15 ps, NOR: 20 ps, DFF clock-to-Q: 50 ps) but are not reflected in the waveform due to the synchronous nature of the design.
