# JPEG-Image-Decoder
Trying to implement advanced circuit technologies to speed up the image decoding process and so to reduce the delays.

First: I tried to implement the architecture for basic 2 Bit JPEG Image Decoder using GATE Level Modelling in Verilog.
and Simulated the circuit using testbench .

Second : Applied Parallel Processing in the circuit and observed the schematic and simulation, which results as increase in the speed of overall circuit but also increased area of circuit.
