# JPEG-Image-Decoder
Trying to implement advanced circuit technologies to speed up the image decoding process and so to reduce the delays.

First: I tried to implement the architecture for basic 2 Bit JPEG Image Decoder using GATE Level Modelling in Verilog.
and Simulated the circuit using testbench .
